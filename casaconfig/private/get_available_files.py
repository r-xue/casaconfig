def get_available_files(urlstr, pattern, skip_network_check):
    """
    Returns a sorted list of all files found at the URL given by 
    urlstr that match the pattern.

    This function does the work for measures_available and data_available.
    The appropriate pattern is set in each of those functions. This function
    does not check on the correctness of pattern (e.g. "tar" should be included
    in the pattern in all cases).

    In addition, this function excludes any file that ends with ".md5" from 
    the returned list. That is only relevent for casarundata but since it may
    happen in the future for some other sites, just exclude it here.

    Note that a skip_network_check of True should only be used if the sites that have_network
    uses to check for connectivity are blocked. It may still be possible to reach 
    the site at urlstr. Setting the config parameter skipnetworkcheck to True should
    be used to skip that through normal casaconfig use.

    Parameters
       - urlstr (str) - The URL to be used when finding the files.
       - pattern (str) - Any files that match this pattern are returned (excluding files ending in md5).
       - skip_network_check (boolean) - when True, skip the initial check that a network connection exists
    
    Returns
        list - the list of file names found at urlstring matching the criteria

    Raises
       - casaconfig.NoNetwork - Raised when there is no network seen, can not continue.
       - urllib.error.URLError - Raised when there is an error fetching some remote content for some reason other than no network.
       - Exception - Unexpected exception while getting the list of available tarfiles.
